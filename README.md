###This simulation will test different methods of solving the
###Monty-Hall problem and return the success rates. Assuming you know the
###rules of the game... The first method will test never switching doors.
###For the first method, you can input the number of doors for the test.
###For the second method, it will ALWAYS switch doors when offered the choice.
###For the third method, it will flip a coin to decide whether to switch
###or not switch. For the last two tests, the number of doors defaults to 3.
###Afterwards, all three results will spit out.
